My name is Joakim Tviberg Fengaas, 30 years old, living in the Norway timezone UTC +0. I am a Frontend development student at Noroff and have been studying for over two years part-time. I have learned incredible things about design and code languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as CSS frameworks, which is interesting and makes it easier to design a responsive website. I`m looking forward to learning more things this year too.
